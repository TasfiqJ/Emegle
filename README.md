# Emegle: Connect, Study, Collaborate

## Inspiration

During the lockdown, finding study partners became increasingly challenging for students, whether in high school or post-secondary education. This inspired us to create a platform where students could virtually meet and study together, connecting with peers who share similar academic interests. Drawing inspiration from Omegle's random matchmaking concept, we aimed to add a unique and engaging twist to our platform.

## What It Does

Emegle allows you to connect and study with a random person studying the same subject and at the same complexity level as you. By inputting your chosen subject and grade level, Emegle's matchmaking algorithm pairs you with a suitable study partner. The platform hosts a video chat session, complete with a chat feature, enabling a seamless and interactive study experience.

## How We Built It

We developed Emegle using a combination of cutting-edge technologies:

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: The backend leverages Node.js and Socket.io to enable real-time text and video communication.
- **Deployment**: We deployed the frontend and backend separately through Firebase, utilizing URL connections to integrate them seamlessly.

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the significant challenges we faced was integrating the backend video chatting server into the frontend to ensure smooth operation without errors. Deploying our website also presented difficulties, as we struggled to properly connect the custom URL created by the backend to the frontend, which was crucial for hosting randomized video chats.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- **Efficient Task Distribution**: We successfully distributed tasks evenly among team members, ensuring everyone had a role to play. This approach allowed us to progress efficiently and stay on track with development.
- **Smooth Integration**: Overcoming the challenges of backend and frontend integration to deliver a functional and user-friendly platform.

## What We Learned

- **Advanced Video Calling Features**: We gained in-depth knowledge of implementing video calling features and online chatting functionalities.
- **Collaborative Development**: Enhancing our skills in working collaboratively as a team to overcome technical obstacles and deliver a successful project.

## What's Next for Emegle

- **Collaborative Whiteboard**: Integrating a feature that allows study partners to use a collaborative whiteboard for note-taking and problem-solving.
- **Group Sessions**: Expanding the platform to support multi-person group study sessions, enhancing collaborative learning opportunities.
